Getting Started

This is for the AE version only

this is not a full guide, it is only meant to help new players get started.

when starting a new game, aftere you create your character you be imediatly pomrpt with the SPECIAL and character naming screen.
after completeing this screen you will be teleported to the inside of the vault 111 cryopod where you will start your adventure.

inside of vault 111 and onward. make sure you pay attention to the once useless vault-tec crates and wooden crates, as there is now very usefull loot inside of them.
once you have your pipboy please wait about 5 minetes before hitting the button to leave the vault, this gives time for some scripts and mods to fully load up.

for players wanting a survival experince, there is a survival section in MO2 with some mods to help you make your experince fit your needs, enable what you need or leave them off.

this guide is still being created as the mod list is devloped farther. if you have any questions or concers please join us in discord and let us know.
